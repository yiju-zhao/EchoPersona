            "content": "Germanane (GeH) field-effect transistors (FETs) show significant potential for improving CMOS circuit performance. GeH FETs outperform similar devices based on 2D materials like MoS2 and black phosphorus in terms of energy-delay product (EDP). The n-type GeH FET exhibits approximately 40% larger on-current than its p-type counterpart, resulting in faster switching speeds and lower power-delay product. By optimizing power supply voltage and threshold voltage, the performance of GeH-based CMOS circuits can be further enhanced to minimize EDP. Comprehensive studies covering material parameterization, device simulation, and circuit analyses demonstrate that germanane is a promising contender for electronic devices in next-generation CMOS technology. The unique properties of GeH, including its heavy and light holes, require careful consideration in device modeling and optimization to fully leverage its potential in CMOS applications.",

            "content": "Germanane Field Effect Transistors (FETs) are electronic devices based on germanane, a two-dimensional material analogous to graphane (hydrogen-terminated graphene). Germanane possesses several advantageous properties that make it promising for electronics and optoelectronics applications. These include a direct band gap, low effective mass, high carrier mobility, and thermodynamic stability. Germanane FETs have been successfully fabricated using multilayer single crystal flakes, demonstrating transport capabilities in both electron and hole doped regimes. These devices exhibit impressive performance characteristics, including on/off current ratios of up to 10^5 at low temperatures (77 K) and 10^4 at room temperature. Carrier mobilities in germanane FETs reach 150 cm\u00b2/(V\u00b7s) at 77 K and 70 cm\u00b2/(V\u00b7s) at room temperature. The ability to function as both n-type and p-type semiconductors, combined with their high mobility and on/off ratios, makes germanane FETs particularly attractive for future electronic applications.",
