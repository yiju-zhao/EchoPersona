            "content": "Short Channel Effect (SCE) is a phenomenon that occurs in semiconductor devices when the channel length of a transistor becomes comparable to the depletion-layer widths of the source and drain junctions. This effect becomes significant as transistors are scaled down to nanometer sizes. SCE leads to various issues in device performance, including a decrease in threshold voltage as the gate length decreases, increased leakage current, and reduced control of the gate over the channel. Other manifestations of SCE include velocity saturation, hot carrier effects, and punch-through. These effects can result in higher power consumption, increased heat generation, and overall degradation of device performance. As transistors continue to shrink, managing and mitigating short channel effects has become a critical challenge in the development of advanced semiconductor technologies, particularly for applications in artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, and other cutting-edge fields.",

            "content": "Germanane (GeH) field-effect transistors (FETs) are a promising new type of electronic device based on a two-dimensional hydrogenated germanium monolayer. These FETs offer several advantages over traditional FETs, including a light effective mass (less than 0.1 m0) and the potential for exceptionally high carrier mobility, theoretically predicted to exceed 18,000 cm2/V\u00b7s. Germanane FETs demonstrate superior performance compared to other 2D materials like MoS2, with n-type GeH FETs showing approximately 40% larger on-current than their p-type counterparts. This results in faster switching speeds and lower power-delay products. The unique properties of germanane, including its low effective mass and high bandgap, make it an attractive channel material for future FET applications. While experimental results have not yet matched theoretical predictions, with measured mobility currently limited to around 30 cm2/V\u00b7s, ongoing research continues to explore the potential of germanane FETs for advanced electronic devices.",
