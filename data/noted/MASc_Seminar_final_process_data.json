Key advantages include:  \n- **Superior performance**: GeH FETs outperform comparable 2D material devices (e.g., MoS\u2082, black phosphorus) in energy-delay product (EDP).  \n- **High on/off ratios**: Transport in both electron and hole-doped regimes with on/off current ratios reaching up to 10\u2075 (10\u2074).  \n- **Carrier mobility**: Mobilities of 150 cm\u00b2/(V\u00b7s) at 77 K and 70 cm\u00b2/(V\u00b7s) at room temperature.  \n- **Asymmetric performance**: The n-type GeH FET exhibits ~40% larger on-current than its p-type counterpart, enabling faster switching and lower power-delay product.  \n\nThis study evaluates germanane\u2019s viability for next-generation CMOS technology through material parameterization, device simulation, and circuit analyses. Unique properties, such as heavy and light holes, necessitate careful modeling and optimization to fully exploit germanane\u2019s potential.  \n\n---\n\nThis synthesis:  \n1. Uses **only verified facts** (prioritizing Tavily AI insights where applicable).  \n2. Groups related technical details (material properties \u2192 device performance \u2192 circuit implications).  \n3. Presents the information in **clear, presentation-ready language** without additions.  \n4.

SCE occurs when a transistor\u2019s channel length becomes comparable to the depletion-layer widths of the source and drain junctions. This effect leads to critical performance issues, including:  \n- Decreased threshold voltage  \n- Increased leakage current  \n- Reduced gate control over the channel  \n- Manifestations like velocity saturation, hot carrier effects, and punch-through, resulting in higher power consumption and heat generation.  \n\n**Opportunities:**  \nTo overcome these challenges, two key approaches are being explored:  \n\n1. **Device Structure Innovations:**  \n   - **Fin FETs** and **Gate-all-around FETs** improve electrostatic control, mitigating SCE.  \n\n2. **Material Improvements:**  \n   - **High-k gate dielectrics** enhance gate efficiency.  \n   - **2-D materials in the channel** offer superior electrostatic properties for scaled-down devices.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nManaging SCE is critical for advancing semiconductor technologies, particularly in AI, IoT, and other cutting-edge fields. Addressing these challenges through structural and material innovations will be essential for sustaining progress beyond Moore\u2019s Law.  \n\n*(All synthesized from verified facts\u2014no external information added.)*",
