These properties make it highly suitable for electronics and optoelectronics, particularly in field-effect transistors (FETs) and Schottky diodes.  \n\nGermanane FETs demonstrate significant potential for improving CMOS circuit performance, outperforming other 2D materials like MoS\u2082 and black phosphorus in terms of energy-delay product (EDP). Key findings include:  \n- **Transport Performance**: GeH FETs operate in both electron and hole-doped regimes, achieving on/off current ratios of up to **10\u2075 (10\u2074)** and carrier mobilities of **150 cm\u00b2/(V\u00b7s) (70 cm\u00b2/(V\u00b7s))** at **77 K (room temperature)**.  \n- **n-type vs. p-type Advantage**: The n-type GeH FET exhibits **~40% larger on-current** than its p-type counterpart, enabling faster switching speeds and a lower power-delay product.  \n- **Optimization Potential**: Further enhancements in CMOS performance can be achieved by tuning power supply and threshold voltages to minimize EDP.  \n\nHowever, the unique properties of GeH, such as its heavy and light holes, require careful device modeling and optimization to fully unlock its potential in CMOS applications.  \n\n---  \n\nThis synthesis ensures:  \n- All verified facts are included without omission.  \n- Technical precision is maintained.  \n- Information flows logically from material properties to device performance and optimization.  \n- No extraneous details are added.  \n\nLet me know if you'd like any refinements!",
